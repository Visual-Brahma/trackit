###### Browser Extension

Automatically save attendance during google meet video calls.

The extension records attendance automatically when you are in a meet and saves it. Once the meet is over it will open the attendance report in a new tab. You can access your saved attendance data anytime on our website [https://trackit.visualbrahma.tech](https://trackit.visualbrahma.tech).
